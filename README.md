# Design Aesthetics for the Web

On this repo the goal is to create a simple HTML page with the basic information about something that interests you, using HTML5 semantics.

This module is all about learning how to use development strategies, so I thought it may be a good oppertunity to add some layers of basic design into my training.

In this project we learned how to structure our workflow via using branching, and now we are branching to simple layout design.

Please feel free to check out all the steps of this project and hopefully it will encourage some enthusiasm.

YEAY
