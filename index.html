# Design Aesthetics for the Web

## Examples from art and design

Think Notre Dame, the Empire State Building, and the Guggenheim Bilbao, or an Eames lounge chair, 
or an Egon Eiermann plywood chair. 

In the world of art, we have such iconic images, like Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and Botticelli's Birth of Venus. 
There's the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh's Starry Night, and Gustav Klimt's The Kiss.

What makes for good design and how good design can affect perception. 

What can we say about the choices that each designer made with regard to fonts, colors, illustrative styles, 
and the intended message behind the design? 

Who's the target audience for each of these images? 

Is it the same audience? 

Should the audience matter? 

Absolutely, the audience should matter. 

Part of being a good designer is learning who the audience is and creating a visual that will appeal to that group. 

So what kinds of things do people find attractive in designs? 

Well, there's things symmetry and alignment. 
The right colors and fonts can also help communicate a message to the viewer, along with any text or images that are included. 
All of these design elements provide a perception of quality and honesty. 
And all of these things help to create good design. 
What do we think when you say good design? 
If it looks good on the outside, like a package, or a brochure, or a website, mustn't the product or service also be of high quality 
on the inside, and more worthy of our consideration than that of a competitor, say, with an inferior design? 

These are great questions worth pondering. 
As a web designer, you have a responsibility to your clients to create designs that promote their image, 
their products, or their services, while also attracting their target audience. 
Hopefully some of this will help improve the aesthetic quality in our designs.
